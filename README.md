# Honeypot-Project
A honeypot is a cybersecurity technique where a decoy system is intentionally set up to appear vulnerable or valuable to attackers, allowing security analysts to monitor and study their behavior.

# Creating our Honeypot VM
We have to go to the azure portal and click on create virtual machine, name our VM ,Resource group and pick our region. Select Debian 11 “Bullseye” -x64 Gen2 as the image.

![1 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34050e8a-e217-4e6a-8bfd-f127bfddeba1)

Select D4s_v3 for the size and fill in the user name and key pair name for the SSH authentication.

In the Disk section, click on “Create and attach a new disk” and change the size to 128 GB. (As per the system requirements for T-pot)

Then create the VM and download the private key to connect to the VM.

# Configuring the Honeypot
Navigate to  VM’s Networking settings in Azure portal and click on ‘Add inbound port rule’.
Change the “Destination port ranges” value to ‘0–65535’ ,then click on Add.
Allowing all ports from 0 to 65535 means that the VM will be reachable on every port the T-pot wants it to.

We need an SSH client like PuTTY to connect to the VM.We have to  Download PuTTY for windows computer and install it. After Installing 
Open the puttygen app file and load  private key that we have downloaded while creating the VM

Now Load the  private key that we’ve downloaded while creating the VM and click “Save private key” and save it.

Close this window and open the putty app file. Provide the public IP address of your VM in ‘Host Name’

![1 8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d628bf1-4ad3-465f-a1f6-595c30cb0b50)

Navigate to the ‘credentials’ and import  private key generated by puttygen . Click on ‘Open’.

Login with  username for the VM.

Now we have to Run these Linux commands to install T-Pot in the VM.
sudo apt update

sudo apt upgrade -y

sudo apt install git

sudo git clone https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce

sudo cd tpotce/iso/installer/

sudo ./install.sh --type=user

After  installing, select the ‘STANDARD’ T-pot edition and provide username and create a password.

We have successfully deployed T-pot in our VM.

# Exploring the T-pot Web Interface

we can open the T-Pot Landing Page from our browser via https://20.204.156.70:64297
we will get a warning from your browser, we have to ignore it and  click on ‘advanced’ and ‘proceed unsafe’.

# Attack Map
Attack map is a live map that shows the geolocations, IP addresses, number of hits and the ports with which the attackers are trying to get in the VM. The Screenshot below was taken just a few minutes after deploying the honeypot. 
 # Note :- If we leave it for 2 or 3 days we will get more attackers
